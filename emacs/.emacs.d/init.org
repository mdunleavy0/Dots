#+TITLE:	Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR:	Michael Dunleavy


* Preface

This is an Org file containing my Emacs configuration. Whenever this
file is saved in Emacs it will automatically collect all of this
document's code snippets into a new ~init.el~. It does so this calling
function =org-babel-tangle=.

The code which configures this document and calls =org-babel-tangle=
is located at the end of this document.


* Header

Warn readers of ~init.el~ not to modify ~init.el~ directly.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :comments no
  ;;
  ;; DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
  ;; This file was automatically generated from init.org using babel.
  ;; Configuration should be done through init.org.
  ;; init.org will automatically generate new versions of this file,
  ;; overwriting any changes made outside of init.org.
  ;;

#+END_SRC


* Customize

~Customize~ is Emacs' system for GUI-based configuration. I do not use
it directly but some modes automatically edit it. This code moves
Customize's state out of ~init.el~ to a separate file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
  (load custom-file)
#+END_SRC


* init.org

** Org-mode Properties

*** Tangling

Mark all source blocks for compilation.

#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle no
  #+PROPERTY: header-args  :tangle yes
#+END_SRC
#+PROPERTY: header-args  :tangle yes


*** Comments

Put comments in output file to denote sections.

#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle no
  #+PROPERTY: header-args+ :comments yes
#+END_SRC
#+PROPERTY: header-args+ :comments yes


*** Results

Prevent evaluation results from being appended to ~init.org~.

#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle no
  #+PROPERTY: header-args+ :results silent
#+END_SRC
#+PROPERTY: header-args+ :results silent


** Emacs File Local Variables

Compile ~init.el~ whenever ~init.org~ is saved in Emacs.

_The start of the local variables list should be no more than 3000
characters from the end of the file..._ I had a very unpleasant time
figuring that out.

#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle no
  # Local Variables:
  # eval: (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'org-babel-tangle nil t)
  # End:
#+END_SRC

# Local Variables:
# eval: (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'org-babel-tangle nil t)
# End:
