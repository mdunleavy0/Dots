Setting up an environment is trickier in Wayland than X11. Much of this is by
design no doubt. "That's not my job" is a core tenet of Wayland and sourcing
unprotected profile scripts is a security risk. Watered-down alternatives are
available such as ~/.config/enviroment.d and ~/.pam_environment, where simple
x=y variable assignments can be made.

Nonetheless, I say screw that. Here are my hacks to get ~/.profile sourced in
Wayland sessions. These modifications do require root privileges.

Sway:
	Open Sway's Wayland session desktop entry
	(/usr/share/wayland-sessions/sway.desktop) and change
		Exec=sway
	to
		Exec=sh -c '. $HOME/.profile; sway'
	Simple.

GNOME:
	The previous solution will not work on GNOME. After some searching I found
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=736660#c49. The idea is to
	execute gnome-session from a login shell, like X11 does. Thus ~/.profile
	will be sourced like any other Bourne login shell.

	Open /usr/bin/gnome-session and change
		exec /usr/libexec/gnome-session-binary "$@"
	to
		exec -l /bin/sh -c /usr/libexec/gnome-session-binary "$@"

	This does appear to have slowed down the login process a little.
